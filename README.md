# Closest Charging EV Station

## Project Overview
This project aims to guide Electric Vehicle (EV) users to the nearest or preferred e-Station using a Machine Learning-based route optimization approach. It ensures that users are directed to charging stations with assured power availability, even in unfamiliar areas.

## Features
- **Real-time EV Charging Station Locator**: Finds the closest charging station based on current location.
- **Machine Learning-Based Route Optimization**: Utilizes predictive analytics to determine the best route using Haversine formula.
- **Google Maps API Integration**: Provides map-based navigation and visualization.
- **Power Availability Check**: Ensures users are directed to stations with sufficient power.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: A simple webpage to showcase the route optimization approach.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: 
- **Database**: for very big data MySQL/PostgreSQL can be used (for storing station data)
- **Google Maps API**: For location and navigation services

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/closest-ev-station.git
   cd closest-ev-station


2. **Set Up API Keys:**  
   - Obtain a Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

  
3. **Run the Application:**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Access the Webpage:**  
   Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Usage
- Give access for finding your location.
- The system will fetch nearby EV charging stations.

## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile App Integration**
- **Dynamic Charging Station Availability Updates**
- **Enhanced Machine Learning Models for Route Prediction**
- **User Reviews & Ratings for Charging Stations**
